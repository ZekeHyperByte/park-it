# Regenerate the booth enrollment token.
#
# Booth PCs redeem this token at POST /api/setup/enroll to fetch the server's
# INTERNAL_API_KEY + Redis address (replaces hand-copying the key). Unlike the
# setup-wizard token it is reusable: one token enrolls every booth brought
# online during the install window. It expires 24h after mint (mtime-based,
# see api/app/services/setup.py).
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./scripts/regen-enroll-token.sh
